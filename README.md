Planned Content:
4 gamemode - (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Arena, and CtF)
Multiple maps
Full online capacity (Somehow this is working)
Armor and Health system akin to Quake 3
Fully customizable loadouts (1 primary, 1 secondary, 1 melee, 1 throwable)
A multitute of weapons, some original, some based on other FPS weps
Voting system for maps and match factors (random crits and such)
An alt-fire for each weapon
Quake and Doom like power ups
A system that allows you to add up to three self buffs with appropiate weaknesses (gain more health but lower movement speed)
An advanced array of movement options (Blast Jumping, trimping, and even bunnyhopping)
An emote system that shows a lil sticker


Current/Important Weapons:
Primaries:
Assualt Rifle - A balanced auto-fire weapon. Does fairly decent damage, requires aim lol (Alt-Fire: Burst fires 3 shots)
Super Shotgun - Oh yes, it's THAT weapon. 2 meatshots will put anything down (Alt-Fire: Shoot both shots in one click)
Sniper Rifle - Classic long-range gun of choice. (Alt-Fire: Aim down the sights to charge up the shot)
Rocket Launcher - An ultra-powerful explosive missile launcher. Shoot at your feet to propel yourself. (Alt-Fire: Detonate the missile whenever you want)
Grenade Launcher - Lobs an explosive pill towards the opponent. Unlike the RPG, it doesn't instantly explode (Alt-Fire: Detonate the last pill lobbed)

Secondaries:
Pistol: A reliable back-up automatic firing mid-range tool that will help out in many situations. Mini-AR, basically. (Alt-Fire: Burst Fires 3 shots)
Shotgun: Deadly up close, but pitiful at a distance. (Alt-Fire: The three cylinders spin and fires automatically/you can hold down the mouse button to fire it quickly and it fires faster but dealls less damage)
Revolver: A peacemaker with surprising range and accuracy. Good at most ranges but struggles against close range. (Alt-Fire: Fan the hammer and release all remaining shots)
SMG: Think pistol but faster firing rate and less accuracy. This weapons works better closer. (Alt-Fire: Spray and pray)

Melee:
